                Websites have been slowly shifting towards minimalistic design for a while now. At the first glance, one might say that designing such a website is beyond easy. In practice, however, what lies beneath those simple websites are hours of fine-tuning and
                harmonizing everything together.
            </p>
            <p class="indent pv2">
                I've kept simplicity in mind from the very beginning of designing this blog. I fondly looked up to <a class="dark-pink link dim" href="https://brutalist-web.design/">Brutalist Web Design</a>, which for me was the perfect minimalist website.
                I've always been a huge fan of brutalist design in architecture and I wanted my website to reflect this.
            </p>
            <p class="indent pv2">
                After scrolling through sources of the aforementioned website, I've decided to use a <a class="dark-pink link dim" href="https://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a> framework and I've immediately fallen in love with it. It gave me freedom similar
                to self-written CSS while keeping my components in harmony - all without much thinking. Using Tachyons saved me plenty of time, since now instead of fine-tuning my variables to every display, I just dropped <i class="silver code">class="pa3 center measure-wide lh-copy tj"</i>                on my div and called it a day (slight exaggeration).
            </p>
            <p class="indent pv2">
                A few hours later, I present to you - my minimalistic blog. I hope you enjoy the content here as much as I enjoy writing it.
